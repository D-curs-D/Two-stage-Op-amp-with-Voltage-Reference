# Two-stage-Op-amp-with-Voltage-Reference
The design is done for the Analog IC Design Hackathon, that was made possible due to the collaboration of VSD, IIT Hyderabad and Synopsys India. The design I have chosen has two components, one a voltage reference circuit and another a general purpose two stage opamp. The design was created and analyzed using synopsys custom design suite.
